    Create an array queue of size 25 to store disk positions to be read.

    Create an integer variable n to store the number of queue requests.

    Create an integer variable headposition to store the initial head position.

    Initialize a variable seek to 0 to track the seek time.

    Create an integer variable maxrange to store the maximum range of the disk.

    Create integer variables temp1 and temp2 to track the indices of arrays queue1 and queue2, respectively.

    Prompt the user to enter the maximum range of the disk and store it in maxrange.

    Prompt the user to enter the number of queue requests and store it in n.

    Prompt the user to enter the initial head position and store it in headposition.

    Read the disk positions to be read into the queue array.

    Create two arrays queue1 and queue2 of size 20 each.

    For each disk position temp in the queue array: a. If temp is greater than the current head position, add temp to queue1. b. Otherwise, add temp to queue2.

    Sort the queue1 array in ascending order.

    Sort the queue2 array in descending order.

    Copy the elements of queue1 into the queue array starting from index 1.

    Set queue[temp1 + 2] to maxrange.

    Copy the elements of queue2 into the queue array starting from index temp1 + 3.

    Set queue[0] to headposition.

    Initialize a variable difference to 0.

    For each index j from 0 to n: a. Calculate the absolute difference between queue[j] and queue[j + 1]. b. Add the calculated difference to seek. c. Print a message showing the movement of the disk head.

    Calculate the average seek time by dividing seek by n.

    Print the total seek time.

    Print the average seek time.

    Create a function absoluteValue that takes an integer x as input.

    If x is positive, return x.

    Otherwise, return the negative of x.
