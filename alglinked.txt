    Start

    Prompt the user to enter the number of files to be allocated.

    For each file, read the file name, start block, and length from the user.

    For each file, iterate through all other files.

    If the start block or length of the current file overlaps with the start block or length of any other file,

    Increment the count variable by one.

    After iterating through all other files, if the count variable is equal to 1,

    This means that the current file does not overlap with any other file.

    Print the file name, start block, and length to the File Allocation Table.

    Otherwise, the current file overlaps with another file.

    Print an error message that the file cannot be allocated disk space.

    Print the File Allocation Table header.

    For each file that was successfully allocated disk space, print the file name, start block, and length to the File Allocation Table.
