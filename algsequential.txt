    Start

    Declare variables: name as a 2D array of characters, start and length as arrays of integers, and num as an integer.

    Print "Enter the number of files to be allocated".

    Read the value for num.

    Initialize variables count, k, and j to 0.

    Use a loop to input file details: a. Print "Enter the name of the file i" (i ranging from 1 to num). b. Read the file name into name[i]. c. Print "Enter the start block of the file i". d. Read the start block into start[i]. e. Print "Enter the length of the file i". f. Read the length into length[i].

    Use a nested loop (j from 0 to num-1, k from 1 to num) to check for conflicts in start and length.

    If start[j + 1] is less than or equal to start[j] or start[j + 1] is greater than or equal to length[j], do nothing.

    Otherwise, increment count.

    If count is 1, print "name[i] cannot be allocated disk space".

    Print "File Allocation Table".

    Print the table headers: "File Name", "Start Block", "Length".

    Print the details of the first file: "name[0]", "start[0]", "length[0]".

    Use a loop to print details for the remaining files: a. If start[i + 1] is less than or equal to start[i] or start[i + 1] is greater than or equal to length[i], print details for the file.
